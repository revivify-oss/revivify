## Community

Revivify is more than a platform — it's a community dedicated to nurturing open source software. We're bringing together:

- New & experienced developers
- Maintainers who need support or transition paths for their projects
- Organizations that depend on the long-term health of the open source ecosystem

We can work together to build a more sustainable future for open source — one where valuable projects aren't simply abandoned, but have paths to revival and ongoing maintenance.
